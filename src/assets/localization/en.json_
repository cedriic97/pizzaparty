Really no sense. You are pushed in and turned around incoherently - and often not even read. But is this the only reason why I am a worse text than others? All right, I'll never be on the bestseller lists. But other texts don't make it either. And that's why it doesn't bother me to be particularly blind. And if you're still reading these lines, I've done something as a small dummy text that all the right and important texts usually only dream about.",
